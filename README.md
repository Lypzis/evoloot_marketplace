# Known Issues

- Due to the current Shopify API key being read-only, certain features such as product management and checkout may not function fully. The project is designed to be fully functional with appropriate API permissions.
- **Responsive Design on Load Only:** The responsive design is applied only on page load. Resizing the browser after the page has loaded may not update the styles dynamically.
